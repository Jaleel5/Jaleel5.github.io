  <section id="myinfo">
    <p class="big">I've always been messing around with technology since a young age, whether it was for playing games, messing around with devices, or troubleshooting something that was having issues.<br>
      Sometimes, I'd spend the whole day trying to do something that'd be way over my head. Even if the day ended with me having zero progress to show, I never completely gave up on trying.<br>
      When the time came to choose a career path, it only made sense to do something tech-related. I was initially drawn to video game development, but as time passed, I found interest in other areas.<br>
      Software development, web development, tech support, and cybersecurity - have all caught my attention, and I'm still interested in becoming more knowledgeable about these fields.<br>
      Although I don't have much experience in the field, I have gathered some skills over the years.
